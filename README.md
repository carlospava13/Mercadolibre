### Feature
1. MVP Architecture:
When compared to the View and Controller in the MVC pattern, the View and Presenter present in the MVP pattern are fully decoupled from each other and they communicate by means of an interface. (The Presenter interact with the Views via View interface, it means that the Presenter can perform all presentation and navigation tasks without any dependency on the actual UI technology being used)
